🍀 A constant function is a mathematical function in which the output value remains constant, regardless of the input.
    In other words, the output of a constant function is independent of the input, which is why it is called constant.

🍀 In general, a constant function is written as:
    f(x) = c or f(n) = c

🍀 Properties of a Constant Function

    1. Constant Output: For any value of  given to the function, the output will always be.
    2. Horizontal Graph: The graph of a constant function on a coordinate plane is a horizontal line at.

🍀Example

    Consider the function. Here, the constant value. No matter what value of  is used, the output will always be 5.

    f(1) = 5

    f(-10) = 5

    f(20) = 5



🍀 Graph

    In a coordinate system, the graph of the function  will be a horizontal line at y = 5.
